<h2>About</h2>

<p>Digestif converts your photostream into an email digest. Your friends and
family subscribe and decide how frequently they want digests delivered. That
way, when you post new photographs your friends and family are notified on their
terms.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>When our son, Henry, was born we wanted to share photographs with our friends
and family. There are so many ways to share your photographs online but they are
all optimized for the photographer, not the viewer.</p>
<ul><li>Facebook forces everyone to be a member of a walled garden.</li>
<li>Instagram. You have to pester your friends and family to download an app and
register.</li>
<li>Flickr is great! But notification of new photographs is tricky (RSS is not simple).</li>
<li>Apple Photostream. Pretty good, if you all own Apple devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, email attachments. Universal. But now you have to spam your friends
and family. Grand-parents may want photos every day but my brother only wants to
see photos once a month. Managing this is a pain. So we created Digestif.</p>

<p><strong>So what are you solving?</strong></p>
<p>Sharing photographs is hard. Not annoying people is hard. Digestif solves
these problems.</p>

<p><strong>Who is behind this?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://jamesclarke.net">James Clarke</a> is building this in-between
Henry's naps at the weekend.</p>
